# Project Vegetation
python code for data visualization and analysis.

# Flow Chart
*Organization by adding an elevation column for explicitly 
*Narrowing the analysis by subsetting an elevation range
*Visualizing the data by using scatterplot and box plot 
*Performing statistical analysis
*Checking conditions for the analysis

# Datasets
*Temperature data from TCCIP (1982 to 2012)
*Rainfall data from TCCIP (1982 to 2012)
*Vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from AVHRR (1982 to 2012)

# How it works
The python file takes in, organizes, and subsets datasets. Produces scatterplots and box plots for visualizing the data, and finally performing statistical analysis on the dataset.

# Libraries used
*For loading data: pandas
*For plotting: matplotlib
*For statistical functions: scipy and statsmodels
